    "In this project, we are going to use a non-linear weighted least squares optimization approach to solve the problem of getting a better estimate of our robot's trajectory. Least squares formulations are widely used for optimization, be it computer vision or robotics or machine learning. We will dive deep into it during this project and you will have complete clarity on optimization for vector-valued residual functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this \"Introduction\" section, I am going to provide an introduction for SLAM problem for a robot operating in the 2D world. It is 2. section in this Project. The 1D SLAM problem (1.) is far much simpler to understand and will be described directly in the 1. section. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a 2D world, a robot has 3 degrees of freedom, i.e. its pose in the world can be expressed by the state vector $\\mathbf{x}=(x, y, \\theta)^{\\mathrm{T}}$. For the scope of this project, we are interested only in the robot's trajectory through the $2 \\mathrm{D}$ world, and NOT in distinct landmarks or the surronding map of the environment, i.e. we are only interested in \"L\"ocalization part of SLAM. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can represent it as a graph where the vertices represent robot poses $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$ and edges represent the spatial constraints between these poses. Such a map is generally called a pose graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two different kinds of constraints are necessary for pose graph SLAM. The first are\n",
    "odometric constraints that connect two successive states $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$ and $\\mathbf{x}_{i+1}$ via a motion model. Furthermore, in order to perform loop closing, the robot has to recognize places it already visited before. This place recognition is also a part of the front-end and provides the second type of constraint, the loop closure constraints. These constraints connect two not necessarily successive poses $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$ and $\\mathbf{x}_{j}$.\n",

    "### Summary of Past, Present & Future of SLAM: Towards the Robust Perception Age.\n",
    "#### Section-IV:Long-Term Autonomy I: Robustess\n",
    "Failure of a SLAM system can occur either at algorithmic level or at hardware level. The main source of algorithmic errors are the errors occuring during Data association process. The problems that occur during data association are the presence of outliers or false positives. The SLAM system has to deal with challenging environments with limited visibility and constantly changing environment. Other data association problems are related to perceptual aliasing. There are problems associated with short term and long term changes in the environment for SLAM system. SLAM systems designed with the assumption of static environment can only work in small scale environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Short term data association is easy to track with camera having sufficient frame rate. Standard procedures like descriptor matching or optical flow can track feautres between consequetive images despite the changes in the environmnet the front end can track and perform short term data associations. Long term data-association involves loop closures detection and validation. The bruteforce approach to loop closure is computationaly intensive as the current image is checked for matching with every other image in the dataset.Bag of words technique quantizes the feature spae and allows more efficient search. Bag of words can give a reliable performance on single precision loop closure but they fail when there are severe illumination variation. This leads to unified representation by using matching sequences and using visual as well as spatial appereances. hese methods reason on the validity of loop closure constraints by looking at the residual error induced by the constraints during optimization. Other methods,instead, attempt to detect outliers a priori, that is, before any optimization takes place, by identifying incorrect loop closures that are not supported by the odometry. The problems associated with robustness can be addressed in the front end or backend of the SLAM system. Some algorithms keep track of changes incured in the dynamic envronment, while main stream techniques do not. Current systems to deal with these problems either maintain multiple maps or have a single representation parameterized by some time-varying parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Open Problmes\n",
    "Current systems are still vulnerable to outliers and regenracies. SLAM systems should have recovery mechanisms to restablish proper operation. A solution to this approach is tighter integration between front end and back end systems of SLAM. \n",
    "\n",
    "Malfunctioning of sensor nodes lead to degradation in accuracy. Off-nominal conditions, or aging or if the quality of the sensors do match with noise models used in the back end it will lead to poor estimates. The problem now becomes to resolve the conflicting readings from different sensors. And it is crucial to resolve these problems in saftey-critical applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "The current SLAM systems and data association methods(descriptors) or not equipped to work reliably under conditions of day and night \n",
    "sequences or between different seasons for metric relocation. Current feature descriptors do not have sufficient invariance to work to work reliably in such circumstances.Spatial\n",
    "information, inherent to the SLAM problem, such as trajectory\n",
    "matching, might be exploited to overcome these limitations.\n",
    "Additionally, mapping with one sensor modality (e.g., 3D\n",
    "lidar) and localizing in the same map with a different sensor\n",
    "modality (e.g., camera) can be a useful addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "SLAM systems are developed only for static and rigid world. Although in the computer vision community and recent non-rigid SFM are able to produce all terrain maps but they are restrictive in thier capabilities. Addressing case of non-rigidity is still a problem which is unexplored. \n",
    "\n",
    "SLAM systems need humann input for assigning thresholds that control feature matching RANSAC parameters. But if the SLAM has to work in all kinds of arbitary scenarios, methods of automatic tuning of the invloved parameters needs to be considered. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Section-IV:Long-Term Autonomy II:Scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "For such applications the size of the\n",
    "factor graph underlying SLAM can grow unbounded, due to\n",
    "the continuous exploration of new places and the increasing\n",
    "time of operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "This family of methods addresses scalability by reducing the number of nodes added to the graph, or by including less informative nodes and factors. Use an information-theoretic approach.To add only non-redundant nodes and highly-informative measurements to the graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another line of work that allows reducing the number of pa-\n",
    "rameters to be estimated over time is the continuous-time tra-\n",
    "jectory estimation. the nodes in the factor graph represented the control-points (knots) of the spline which were optimized in a sliding window fashion. This idea has been further improved and optimized by a lot of people, and they are were able to extend it to large scale applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel out-of-core algorithms for SLAM split the computation (and memory) load of factor graph optimization among multiple processors. The key idea is to divide the factor graph into different subgraphs and optimize the overall graph by alternating local optimization of each subgraph, with a global refinement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed multi robot SLAM: One way of mapping a large-scale environment is to deploy multiple robots doing SLAM, and divide the scenario in smaller areas, each one mapped by a different robot. This approach has two main variants: the centralized one, where robots build submaps and transfer the local information to a central station that performs inference, and the decentralized one, where there is no central data fusion and the agents leverage local communication to reach consensus on a common map. \n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantage of the using popluar method of Gaussian elemination is that the marginals to be exchanged among the robots are large sized and the communication cost is quadratic in the number of seperators. An alternate approach to Gaussian elimination method is Gauss-Sidel approach which implies a communication burden which is linear in the number of seperators. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open problems\n",
    "Despite the work done to reduce the complexity of the factor graph optimization, there have been a lot of aspcets which have been unexplored. \n",
    "For example Storage of map/point cloud data or volumetric maps in the memory for extended period of time. While other questions upon which adequete work has not been done are 'How long should a map be remembered or be in the storage?', When should a map be updated and when is a map or data considered to be outdated?. \n",
    "Another opend ended problem is rejection of outliers in a distributed robot system. The problems with multi robot system are that they do not share a common frame of reference and they have to detect outliers using partial and local information. Some of the attempts that were made were to timely check and verify the thier location and their prediction of the trajectory at probably at a specified location(rendezvous strategy) before fusing information.\n",
    "Another problem is to adapt SLAM algorithms in places where severe computational resource constraints exist. This can be seen where the size of the plaotform is scaled down, for example in Mobile phones, micro areial vehicles or robotic insects. Other problems that can arise due to hardwareAnother constraints is the limited bandwidth and communication dropout. And so it would be desirable to have algorithms in which one can tune accuracy with computational load. \n"

    "### Robusteness \n",

Slam Recovery - We have established that incorrect measurements are bound to creep up due to localisation problem , we need to have a robust fraud detection system (can use temporal features - previous set of images) to identify whether the input is a valid input or not and reject those below a certaing confidence threshold.\n",
    "2. Non Dynamic Mapping - The real world is constantly evolving and changing , thus systems to address these are needed. This will require identifying things in a constantly changing environment. A very interesting use case for the same is described in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05444) which aims to visualise 3d mapping of internal organs."
